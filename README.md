# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
I created this work day scheduler so I can have a site to help me easily stay organized. Not only does it save my agenda to the local storage, but it also visually tells me what hours have passed. When I see the red box, I know I am in the current hour. All the boxes that are green tell me it is in the future. By looking at my work day scheduler, I can be a lot more oragnized with my schoolwork. Before this site, I didnt have a planner for my daily responsibilities.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
When the user opens the site, they will be presented with a blank schedule of the date, including the hours form 9am-5pm. The user can then enter information into each box and press the save button. When the website reloads, the saved information will remain in place.
